# DeepFake-detection-and-mitigating-security-risks
Proposing a Machine learning model which uses MobileNet that helps in classifying the images and segregating them into real images and deepfakes...
We use python programming language for the entirety of the program
• Modules like Tensorflow, Keras, CLAHE, OpenCV, OS have been used for image processing and training the model
• Flask has been used to deploy the model locally
